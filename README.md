# The Odin Project - Project: Knights Travails

A function that shows the shortest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.

Special thanks: Casssb (https://github.com/Casssb/knights-travails). I don't think I would have figured out how to get a route without the concat function.
