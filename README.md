# The Odin Project - Project: Knights Travails

A function that shows the shortest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.

To run this project on your local server, make sure you have Node JS installed and then type:

```
node knights-travils.js
```

Special thanks: Casssb (https://github.com/Casssb/knights-travails). I don't think I would have figured out how to get a route without the concat function.
